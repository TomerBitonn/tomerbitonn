## üöÄ Projects

### üïπÔ∏è 2D Game Built with Python and Pygame  
Built a fully functional 2D game using **Python** and the **Pygame** library, applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
The game includes a real-time game loop, collision detection, event handling, scoring system, and keyboard input - covering all the core parts of an interactive game.

### üåê Website for Refael Designs - Family Carpentry Business  
As a self-initiated project, I built a complete website from scratch for my family‚Äôs carpentry business using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Flask** (Python).  
I deployed it on an **AWS EC2** instance, configured a custom domain via **Route 53** with **HTTPS** support, and ensured full responsiveness across devices.  
The site includes a **contact form**, **accessibility widget**, and **legal pages**.  
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in front-end and back-end development, cloud deployment, and full-stack web hosting - building a real product end-to-end while independently learning each technology.
